This tune is one of the RoR basics.

This tune is played over 8 beats instead of 4, so take care when counting in.

Although is the only tune called Funk, is not the only that sounds “funky”. There are two other, Karla Shnikov and
Angela Davis. Just try to combine them, especially Funk-Angela Davis sounds great.

## Background

**Name:** Funk is a style of music that was created in the 1960s by African Americans. As most/all African American music, it originates from African music traditions and has also been used heavily in black rights movements throughout history. The pioneer of Funk is James Brown. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funk))

**Musical background:** The definining characteristic of Funk seems to be a base hit on the 1 and 3 and a snare hit on the 2 and 4. It seems that the tune doesn't actually sound like Funk. *(More info needed.)*

**Sign:** *(More info needed.)*

**History:** Was introduced to the network at least 2008 (together with Ragga). A slightly different version called “Lego Funk” has been played by Barking Bateria: [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/barking-bateria/lego-funk)

## Difficulty

Good to begin with, because all instruments are quite easy:

* **Surdos**: easy (all surdos play the same line and there are tons of memoryhook-phrases)
* **Repi**: medium (the repi is not that easy, but anyway it’s a good tune to begin with, because you find different repi-hits)
* **Snare**: easy
* **Tamborim**: easy
* **Agogô**: easy (because they can look at the surdos for almost any hit they play)

## Breaks

* Break 1, which is a call & response-break between Surdos and all others
* Break 2, where everyone plays one bar of eighth-notes
* Call Break, two breaks wich are played the same way (five hits in the beginning) but end with a shout of either “oi!”
  or “uah!”. They can be used in almost any tune, not just this one. Some bands play around with the shouting break by
  using other shouts in the end. This way it’s also possible to connect a political output to this breaks.
