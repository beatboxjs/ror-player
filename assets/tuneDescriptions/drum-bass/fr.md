Sounds more like Hip-Hop than Drum ‘n’ Bass but has a really nice groove. Can be
very cheerful when played quite fast or be groovy when played slow.

The Low Surdo is very important in this tune because it gives the special hip
hop rhythm and “carries” the tune. There are different versions on the tune
sheets but both sound good ;). Since none of the Surdos play at the same time,
it is also possible to play this tune with only one or two surdo players and
three surdos. To remember the Surdo lines it is also helpful to sing them all
together (low, high, middle middle, low, high-low, low, high, middle middle,
low, high…).

**Sign:** With one hand in your ear lift the other and move it front and back
(like a DJ).

## Contexte

**Name:** Drum&Bass is a style of electronic music that developed in the 1990s
in the UK. Characteristic for it is its really fast and strong base.
([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drum_and_bass))

**Musical background:** The baseline of the tune somewhat resembles Drum&Bass,
although Drum&Bass is usually played much faster at 165–185 bpm, while RoR Tunes
are usually played at around 100–120 bpm. At this speed, the tune more sounds
like Hip Hop, and a very similar base line can be heard in several hip hop songs
such as this: [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UePtoxDhJSw).

**Sign:** The sign depicts a DJ.

**History:** First mentioned in 2010 by RoR Bremen. Has been developed on a
transnational basis between 2009 & 2010. Barking Bateria also mentions a tune
with this name [on their
website](https://web.archive.org/web/20061023061031/http://www.barkingbateria.co.uk/samba.htm)
in 2006, although it is not clear whether it is the same tune.

## Breaks

* Break 1 is a singing break (no drumming, all sing together "everybody dance
  now!”), brings a good mood and moves and can be used to involve audience. This
  break can be played in all other tunes as well.
* Break 2 is similar to the “Kick Back 2 Break” from the tune Ragga. Be aware
  that only repi and snare play on the 8th beat before it goes back into the
  tune.
* Break 3 is a little tricky but once mastered, sounds really nice.
* The Progressive break is quite easy and can creates tension. With the special
  hand sign for this break it is easy to include it while playing other tunes.
* The Hip Hop Break (the hand sign is supposed to look really cool
  hip-hop-stylish, everyone does it their way) sounds really groovy but is also
  quite tricky for the surdos (a memory-hook phrase is helpful).
