## Kontekst

**Name:** Coupé-Décalé is a type of club dance music popular in Côte d’Ivoire.
It was developed in Paris by Ivorian DJs and eventually brought back to Côte
d’Ivoire, where it became very popular. Some say that it represents the desire
of a young generation to bring more party, carefreeness and openness to the
world into a country shaped by its unstable political situation and dominated by
patriotic and military music. “Coupé-Décalé” means something like “cheated
somebody and then run away”, which is generally interpreted to stand for famous
Coupé-Décalé artists “tricking” France and Western Europe to successful and
famous there and then returning to Côte d’Ivoire.
