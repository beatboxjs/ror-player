## Kontekst

**Name:** Saimaannorppa or Saimaa ringed seal is an endangered animal species
that only lives in one lake in Finland. They like to chill out on warm rocks.
Norppas were nearly hunted to extinction in the 20th century, as it was
considered an enemy to the fishing industry. Conservation began in 1979 and
saved it from extinction. Since then, it has became the symbol of nature
conservation in Finland. Climate change poses a direct threat to the Norppa.

**Musical background:** Song takes inspiration from the electronic music, but
does not imitate any particular genre or song.

**History:** Rediscovered from old notes by RoR Helsinki in 2021
