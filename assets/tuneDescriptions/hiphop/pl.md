## Kontekst

**Name:** Hip hop is an art movement that originated in the 1970s from Black and
Latino communities in New York. Often only associated with rap, the hip hop
culture includes many more elements such as breakdance, graffiti and beatboxing.
Originally an underground movement and a tool to protest against the oppressive
state institutions, it was discovered in the 1990s by the music industry, who
started making huge profits by marketing it towards a white male audience. Over
the years, Hip hop has become one of the most popular genres of music worldwide,
and not much is left of its original purpose. Some white pop musicians have been
criticized for cultural appropriation and commercializing hip hop culture.

**Musical background:** The tune is based on Hip hop beats.

**Sign:** A common hand gesture that Hip hop artists like to make ([example on
YouTube](https://youtu.be/010KyIQjkTk)).

**History:** Invented by someone from RoR Berlin in 2005, but never published.
Was rediscovered in 2021.
