## Kontekst

**Name:** The original name of this tune was German „Wütende Heinzelmenschen“,
which has been translated as “angry dwarfs”. „Heinzelmenschen“ (officially but
gendered: „Heinzelmännchen“) are small human creatures in a local tale in
Cologne, who, according to the tale, secretly did all the work for the people of
Cologne at night, so that the people could be lazy during the day. One day,
someone got curious to see them and set up a trap, so they got really angry and
left. From that day on the people had to do all the work themselves.

**Sign:** The hand signal refers to the pointed cap that Heinzelmenschen are
wearing on their heads.

**Musical background:** *(More info needed.)*

**History:** Local tune from RoR Cologne, published in 2006. Was removed from
the tune sheet in 2012.
