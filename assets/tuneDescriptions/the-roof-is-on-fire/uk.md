**Name:** “The roof is on fire” is part of the chorus in the song “Fire Water
Burn” by the Bloodhound Gang
([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Adgx9wt63NY)), which covers the
chorus of the song “The Roof Is on Fire” by Rock Master Scott & the Dynamic
Three ([YouTube](https://youtu.be/-Vv_LwwwpmU?t=263)). Also, the roof of the
sauna was literally on fire during the TNM 2019 in Lithuania.
