The tune is rather easy to learn, because a lot of the voices and breaks are similar to other rhythms. Also there are
kind of three groups which are each synchronized:

* Surdos playing after each other so it becomes a – quite slow – easy memorize-able melody.
* Snare & Repi play basically the same line but desynchronized → it’s possible to base the one voice on the other
* Tambs & Agogô play the same, just that the Tambs have only one possible tone while the Agogô has two.

**Sign:** fists before breast, open hands and arms

### Background

“Nova Balança” means “new wave” in Brazilian. It’s part of a belief that the new wave will come and bring the deported
slaves back home.

### Difficulty

* **Surdos**: medium
* **Repinique**: easy
* **Snare**: easy
* **Tamborim**: easy
* **Agogô**: easy – in fact the same as in Karla Shnikov

### Breaks

* Break 1 is basically the same as Funk break 2, but to be played from soft to really, really loud!!! Try not to speed up whilst you’re playing it.
* Break 2 is kind of a kickback break, between the surdos and everyone else; it has the same rhythm as the afoxe tamborim line
* Bra Break is a call and response between the snare and everyone else.
