**Sign:** smoke a joint like a cup of tea (with thumb and index finger)

## Фон

**Name:** See Samba Reggae. Sheffield is a city in the UK that used to have a
very active RoR band.

**Musical background:** A typical Samba Reggae tune.

**Sign:** The sign is a mix between drinking tea and smoking a joint. Drinking
tea is a common activity in the UK (not sure if there is a specific connection
to Sheffield). Smoking joints is a main ritual in the Rastafari religion, which
is closely linked to Reggae music.

**History:** Introduced to the network by RoR London in 2012, was probably
played there before?

## Суперечки

The rhythm clearly sounds like real Samba Reggae, which is a tune developed and
used by the Black liberation movement in Brazil. Many people in the RoR network
consider it cultural appropriation to play this tune in our mainly white
European bands, and there is an ongoing debate about abolishing the tune.

There is also some criticism towards the sign, which is based on a racist
stereotype.
