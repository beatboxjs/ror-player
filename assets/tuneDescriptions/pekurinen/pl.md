## Kontekst

**Name:** Arndt Pekurinen (1905–1941) was a Finnish pacifist and antimilitarist,
who opposed all forms of violence, and refused to join the war. He was
imprisoned after he became a famous peace symbol, and his hunger strike was
supported by an extensive international campaign. Pekurinen was executed without
a trial. His actions forced the government to change laws to allow peaceful,
non-military civil service.
