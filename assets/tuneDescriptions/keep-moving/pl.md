**Sign:** “Walk” with two fingers on the other hand.

## Kontekst

**History:** This tune was developed in 2024 by a member of Extinction
Rebellion.

**Name:** The name has a double meaning. Literally, this tune serves to keep the
group moving. By moving along with the music, you stay in the mood and thus come
across as very convincing. It also helps keep the atmosphere right for the whole
(action) group. A moving rhythm band is contagious, unlike an unmoving one. The
second meaning is perhaps the most important. “Keep moving” in the sense of
“stay committed, persevere, resist”. Don't give up the fight, together we stand
strong to strive for a climate-just world and take the action needed to raise
awareness about current issues among a large part of the population. Don’t give
up hope! There have already been many victims, but step by step we are creating
a world where every human being, every life on this planet counts. Let’s act for
climate justice all over the world! Keep moving!

**Musical background:** The music symbolises being in constant motion, with some
exceptions. Occasionally, the music stops, emphasising the need for breaks,
moments to reflect and (natural) silence.

**Sign:** Symbolises walking, moving.
