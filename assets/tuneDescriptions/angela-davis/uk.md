This tune is one of the RoR basics.

In this tune, the Low Surdo swaps one of its beaters for a plastic Repinique
stick (aka a whippy stick) to get a higher pitched sound. Then it plays a
combination of high-pitched and normal hits.

**Sign:** pull two prison bars apart in front of your face

## Фон

**Name:** Angela Davis is an Afro-American activist from the USA. She
experienced a lot of oppression as a university professor due to her political
views and involvement in the black liberation, communist and radical feminist
movement. She became a major figure of the prison abolishment movement after
being imprisoned for a murder that she did not commit.
([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_Davis), see also the
documentary “Free Angela & All Political Prisoners”)

**Musical background:** Break 1 sounds like from “Sex machine” by James Brown,
Low Surdo is based on the drumset rhythm of this song, not sure if the rest of
the tune is also based on his music.

**Sign:** The sign represents prison bars, because Angela Davis is a major
figure in the prison abolishment movement.

**History:** Part of the first set of tunes taken from Barking Bateria in 2000.
The name used to be “James Brown” (famous musician from the USA) and the sign
was to depict an afro haircut. James Brown didn’t have an afro haircut for most
of his life, but later got one as it became a symbol of Black pride. The tune
was renamed because of domestic violence and rape accusations against James
Brown, and Angela Davis was chosen because she fit the tune sign. Later the tune
sign was changed. We consider both the old tune sign itself and the fact that
Angela Davis was chosen because of her afro hair as racist.

## Суперечки

There is an ongoing discussion in the RoR network whether we should play a tune
that is based on the music of a rapist.

Some RoR members from the Baltic States have recently raised concerns that the
tune is named after Angela Davis, who was a member of the Communist Party and
actively collaborating with the oppressive regime of the Soviet Union.

* Break 2 is a call&response between Surdos and everyone else, it is ended by
  the pattern of Break 1.
* Break 3 is a loop which is played by everyone except the Snare (which just
  continues its normal groove). At the end (or every time just before the Break
  starts again from the beginning) the pattern of Break 1 is played.

Combinations of Angela Davis and Funk sound nice (changing between both,
introducing break of one on the other, etc.). In fact, Angela Davis is a kind of
funk too.
