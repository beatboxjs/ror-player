A quite groovy tune that can be played slowly for a long time. The Surdos make a
melody, so they are suitable to be played by one Surdo player with three Surdos.

**Sign:** monkey, both hands in armpits

## Фон

**Name:** Orangutan is a critically endangered species of apes native to
south-east Asia.

**Musical background:** *(More info needed.)*

**Sign:** The sign depicts a monkey

**History:** Introduced to the network by RoR London in 2012, was probably
played there before?

## Controversies

There is a debate about removing all monkey references from the tune name and
breaks, since racist stereotypes associate monkeys with Black people (who are
also often associated with drumming).
