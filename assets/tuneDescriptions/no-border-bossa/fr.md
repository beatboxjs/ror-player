## Contexte

**Name:** Bossa Nova is a Brazilian style of music that developed out of Samba,
which usually involves a guitar and a singer on top of the characteristic Bossa
Nova beat.

**Musical background:** The Surdo line is very similar to the Bossa Nova beat.
The Bossa clave is the clave that we use at RoR. See
[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZ_mEmaJu98).

**Sign:** The sign probably depicts a border fence that is opened.

**History:** From RoR Maastricht. “A former Amsterdam band member was cleaning
her room and found an old notation of a ‘no border bossa’. The paper points to
Maastricht.”
