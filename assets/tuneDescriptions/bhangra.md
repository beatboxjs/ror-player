Was chosen as a **Tune of the Year 2021** (along with Sambasso).

If the players or the audience needs a rest, Bhaṅgṛā is a good tune to play.

But be aware of the 6/8 rhythm. On the notation sheet, every step is divided into only 3 hits (instead of 4 in the 4/4).
When playing it for the first time, you might have to concentrate in order to not get stuck in the usual 4/4 rhythm.
This is particularly important when switching from or into a different tune.

If you play breaks from other tunes which are based on 16 hits in a 4/4 pattern (eg. “Karla Break”, or “8 Up”), try
to play 12 hits in a 6/8 pattern. In the beginning it’s quite hard (because the 4/4 is stuck in your head) but after a
while it’s great – make sure tho whole band plays like this, if some plays it differently it can get very chaotic…

## Background

**Name:** Bhaṅgṛā is a traditional folk dance from Punjab (a region in northern India and eastern Pakistan) ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhangra_(dance))). It was typically danced by farmers during the harvesting season, to the beat of a Dhol. Dhols are double-sided drums where one side is hit with a heavy wooden stick, creating a deep sound, and the other side with a light stick, creating a high sound.

Nowadays, Bhaṅgṛā also refers to a style of pop music that was invented by Punjabi immigrants in Great Britain and North America. Its beat somewhat resembles a faster version of the Dhol rhythm in traditional Bhaṅgṛā drumming ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhangra_(music))).

**Musical background:** The Surdo and Tamborim lines very closely resemble the rhythm that the low and high side of the Dhol is playing to the traditional Bhaṅgṛā folk dance. Several examples can be found on YouTube when searching for “Bhangra drumming” or “Punjabi drumming” (searching for just “Bhangra” will bring up mostly modern Bhaṅgṛā pop music, where the similarity to our tune is very small).

**Sign:** The sign is a common gesture to greet or honour someone in India and Southeast Asia. In Hindu, the gesture is called Namaste.

**History:** Part of the second round of tunes that was introduced by Barking Bateria in 2004/2005.

## Difficulty

* **Surdos:** easy
* **Repi:** easy
* **Snare:** easy
* **Tamb:** medium
* **Agogô:** easy

## Breaks

* Break 1 and 2: are very similar, but luckily, there are memory-phrases to help you memorize and distinguish them.
  Singing them together in a rehearsal is also a good idea. (btw: papadam is an indian bread)
* Break 3: is a variation of the Agogô voice; everyone just plays the Agogô rhythm on one tone. The pause at the end
  of the normal Agogô voice is not taken into account.
* Call Break: where the Repi calls and everyone else answers. There’s an intermezzo, where the Surdos play something
  similar to the Tamb-stroke and at the end everyone shouts “ey”. While it seems really hard to learn at first, you’ll
  see that the break will be stuck in your ear already after you heard it a few times.
