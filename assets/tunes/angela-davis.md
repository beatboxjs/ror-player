**Sign:** pull two prison bars apart in front of your face

## Background

**Name:** Angela Davis is an African American activist who experienced a lot of oppression as a university professor due to her political views and involvement in the Black liberation, communist and radical feminist movement. She became a major figure of the prison abolishment movement after being imprisoned for a murder that she did not commit. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_Davis), see also the documentary “Free Angela & All Political Prisoners”)

**Musical background:** Break 1 and the low surdo part sound like “Sex machine” by James Brown.

**Sign:** The sign represents prison bars, because Angela Davis is a major figure in the prison abolishment movement.

**History:** Part of the first set of tunes taken from Barking Bateria in 2000. The name used to be “James Brown” and the sign depicted an afro. The tune was renamed because of domestic violence and rape accusations against James Brown, and Angela Davis was chosen because she fit the tune sign. Later the tune sign was changed. RoR considers both the old tune sign itself and the fact that Angela Davis was chosen because of her afro hair as racist.

## Controversies

There is an ongoing discussion in the RoR network on playing a tune that is based on the music of a rapist. Some XR bands have chosen not to play it in the past for similar reasons.

Some RoR members from the Baltic States have raised concerns that the tune is named after Angela Davis, who was a member of the Communist Party and actively collaborated with the oppressive regime of the Soviet Union.

## Breaks

* **Break 1** consists of a pickup followed by a bar of eighth notes.
* **Break 2** is a call and response between surdos and everyone else, ending with the pattern of Break 1.
* **Break 3** is a loop played by everyone except the snares (which just continue their normal part) and also ends with the pattern of Break 1 each time.
