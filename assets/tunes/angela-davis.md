This tune is one of the XR Rhythms basics.

In this tune, the Low Surdo swaps one of its beaters for a plastic Repinique stick (aka a whippy stick) to get a higher
pitched sound. Then it plays a combination of high-pitched and normal hits.

**Sign:** pull two prison bars apart in front of your face

## Background

**Name:** Angela Davis is an Afro-American activist from the USA. She experienced a lot of oppression as a university professor due to her political views and involvement in the black liberation, communist and radical feminist movement. She became a major figure of the prison abolishment movement after being imprisoned for a murder that she did not commit. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_Davis), see also the documentary “Free Angela & All Political Prisoners”)

**Musical background:** Break 1 sounds like from “Sex machine” by James Brown, Low Surdo is based on the drumset rhythm of this song, not sure if the rest of the tune is also based on his music.

**Sign:** The sign represents prison bars, because Angela Davis is a major figure in the prison abolishment movement.

**History:** Part of the first set of tunes taken from Barking Bateria in 2000. The name used to be “James Brown” (famous musician from the USA) and the sign was to depict an afro haircut. James Brown didn’t have an afro haircut for most of his life, but later got one as it became a symbol of Black pride. The tune was renamed because of domestic violence and rape accusations against James Brown, and Angela Davis was chosen because she fit the tune sign. Later the tune sign was changed. We consider both the old tune sign itself and the fact that Angela Davis was chosen because of her afro hair as racist.

## Controversies

There is an ongoing discussion in the RoR network whether we should play a tune that is based on the music of a rapist.

Some RoR members from the Baltic States have recently raised concerns that the tune is named after Angela Davis, who was a member of the Communist Party and actively collaborating with the oppressive regime of the Soviet Union.

## Difficulty

* **Low Surdo:** hard
* **Mid Surdo:** easy to remember, but hard to play it without beeing to fast nor to slow
* **High Surdo:** medium
* **Repi:** easy
* **Snare:** easy (there are some variations)
* **Tamborim:** easy
* **Agogô:** medium

## Breaks

* Break 1 consists of a pickup followed by a bar of eight-notes.
* Break 2 is a call&response between Surdos and everyone else, it is ended by the pattern of Break 1.
* Break 3 is a loop which is played by everyone except the Snare (which just continues its normal groove). At the end
  (or every time just before the Break starts again from the beginning) the pattern of Break 1 is played.

Combinations of Angela Davis and Funk sound nice (changing between both, introducing break of one on the other, etc.).
In fact, Angela Davis is a kind of funk too.
