We have quite a few! They have their own signs so you use them in any song.

Once your band has the core tunes and breaks down, learning more general breaks is a great next step.

You can give breaks and directions to different instruments, so you can do a lot with just a few of them.

Have a look at the **Tune Sheet linked above** for descriptions of the breaks (including ones without sound files) as well as **instrument signs**, **general directions** and **some chants**.
