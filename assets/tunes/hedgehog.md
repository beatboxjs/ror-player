This is one of our core tunes and often one of the first ones new bands learn. It helps that everyone is playing pretty much the same rhythm.

## Difficulty

* **Low Surdo**: easy

* **Snare**: medium

## Breaks

* The only break we have for this song (involving shouting “Act now!” or whatever slogan) can be signed as **Break 1 or Break 2** – perhaps better as Break 2 since there's an RoR Hedgehog Break 1. Either way, there's only one.
* **General breaks** that work well: 4 hits surdos with everyone else carrying on
