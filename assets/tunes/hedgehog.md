This tune is in a tango rhythm which goes along for 8 steps/two bars. Nearly every instrument plays parts of the same
rhythm. Therefore it’s easy to learn.

Hedgehog sounds great when it is played combined with ragga (a Tango-rhythm too). As an example, just try introducing
Ragga kick-backs or Zorro break playing the groove pattern. Try continuing playing this break until a Hedgehog break
or similar is called.

Both the Hedgehog call and Break 1 are stretched over 8 beats but the notes/shouts only happen in the last 2 or 4 beats.
It is important for the mestre to count from the start of the 8 beats to get the timing right (marked with ">" on the
notation). Everyone else keeps playing their normal rhythm until they are counted in - don’t stop!

## Breaks

It has only two breaks, which are (in contrast to every other break) both meant to be counted in in the beginning of
the 8 steps, so the groove is really interrupted by the breaks.

In Break 1 only the Surdos play four hits (one on every step) while everyone else continues.

The Hedgehog Break is just one hit on the first step and the shout “hedge-hog!” with the syllables on the third and
fourth step. (it can also be replaced by a political message, eg. “stop g8”)
