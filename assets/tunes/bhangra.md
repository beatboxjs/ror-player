This is one of our core tunes, and rare because it's a bouncy, 6/8 one:

It goes *1-and-a, 2-and-a, 3-and-a, 4-and-a* (like a jig) instead of *1-a-and-a, 2-a-and-a, 3-a-and-a, 4-a-and-a*.

Some general breaks work best altered to divide each beat into three rather than four (e.g. Karla break, Progressive Karla).
Some work as they are, and others are best avoided. Good to experiment with!

**Sign:** wavy hands snaking up.

## Background

**Name:** Bhangra is a traditional folk dance from the Punjab (a region in northern India and eastern Pakistan) ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhangra_(dance))). It was typically danced by farmers during the harvesting season, to the beat of a Dhol, a double-sided drum where one side is hit with a heavy wooden stick, creating a deep sound, and the other side with a light stick, creating a high sound.

Nowadays, Bhangra also refers to a style of pop music that was invented by Punjabi immigrants in the UK and USA. Its beat somewhat resembles a faster version of the Dhol rhythm in traditional Bhangra drumming ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhangra_(music))).

**Musical background:** The surdo and tam lines very closely resemble the rhythm that the low and high side of the Dhol is playing to the traditional Bhaṅgṛā folk dance. Several examples can be found on YouTube when searching for “Bhangra drumming” or “Punjabi drumming” (searching for just “Bhangra” will bring up mostly modern Bhangra pop music, which is fairly unlike our tune).

**Sign:** Changed from "prayer hands" for cultural sensitivity.

**History:** Part of the second round of tunes that was introduced by Barking Bateria in 2004/2005.

## Difficulty

* **Surdos:** easy
* **Repi:** easy
* **Snare:** easy
* **Tam:** medium (use an up-and-down or side-to-side motion to avoid your arm falling off)
* **Agogô:** medium

## Breaks

* **Break 1** is a call and response between surdos and everyone else
* **Break 3** is a short break following the agogô line
* The **7 break** is taken from the last line of the call break and we use it a lot as a general break (The shout is great!)
* The **Butterfly break** is an extended version of the 7 break and can also be used as a general break
* The **Call break** is longer but well worth learning
* **Break 2** is quite close to Break 1, and everyone plays the same thing _\[uncommon nationally\]_
* **General breaks** that work well: 4 hits, 8 hits, Flappy Mouth, Whistle break
