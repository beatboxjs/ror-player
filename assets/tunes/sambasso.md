One of the tunes we learned at the first 2022 samba camp. That reggaeton beat is infectious!

**Sign:** V with 4 fingers (Vulcan salute) on both hands, sliding the gaps into each other

## Background

**Name:** Probably a combination of the words “Samba” and “basso” (Italian for “low” or “base”).

**Musical background:** The snare line, repi line and call break seem to be samba reggae style. *(More info needed.)*

**Sign:** *(More info needed.)*

**History:** Introduced to the network by RoR London in 2012, was probably played there before?

## Difficulty

* **Surdos:** easy (though be careful not to zone out!)
* **Repi:** hard
* **Snare:** hard
* **Tam:** easy. The original RoR part is very tricky so we replaced it with the rhythm from Break 1
* **Agogô:** hard

## Breaks

* **Break 1** is led with the whistle, which is a nice novelty, and for smaller bands can be whistled in without any warning
* **Break 2** is a call and response with the surdos
* The **Call break** (aka the Intro) is an intricate bit of actual samba reggae that, sadly, probably isn't feasible nationally _\[not played nationally\]_
