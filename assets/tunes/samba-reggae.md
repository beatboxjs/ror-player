This is one of our core tunes. Together with Custard, it's our tune that sounds most like “real” samba.

Like real samba, many of the breaks are more complicated, especially compared to our other tunes. Don't feel like you have to learn them all!

Since practically every samba band can play a version of samba reggae, it's a good tune to play together with non-XR/RoR bands.

## Background

**Name:** Samba Reggae is the original afro bloc rhythm, a mix of samba and reggae created by the Black liberation movement in Brazil. Samba reggae is a sub-genre of samba that arose in the context of Afro-Brazilians fighting for their right to play samba music and partake in Carnival parades in the late 1960s. At that time only white people were allowed to play in the parades for Carnival and in the samba schools of Rio de Janeiro. Samba reggae is a samba style that developed because Black people in Brazil wanted to have a samba style to call their own, incorporating influences from the Black diaspora such as reggae and funk. The music of the afro blocos aimed to recreate and strengthen the Afro-Brazilian community. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samba_reggae))

In “real” Samba, ‘samba reggae’ is a specific sub-genre in terms of the rhythm and also what instruments are used and how they are played, which is different from other kinds of samba. For example the repi, which otherwise is mostly worn quite high and played with a short wooden stick and the hand, is worn low and played with two long plastic rods.

**Musical background:** The tune is a mix of Samba Reggae 1 and 3. RoR Samba Reggae is played with mid surdo hitting in 1 and 3 beats and low one in 2 and 4 (mid-low-mid-low,low), while most of the samba bands used to play with low surdo in 1 and 3 and mid one in 2 and 4 (low-mid-low-mid,mid). Repi and snare grooves use to be swapped too. As XR bands often don't have mids, our lows often play the first hit as a silent stroke (hit with your hand muffling) to replace them.

**Sign:** Changed at the first 2022 samba camp from “smoking a joint” because just wow.

**History:** Part of the first set of tunes taken from Barking Bateria in 2000.

## Controversies

The rhythm clearly sounds like real Samba Reggae, which is a tune developed and used by the Black liberation movement in Brazil. Many people in the RoR network consider it cultural appropriation to play this tune in our mainly white European bands, and there is ongoing debate about abolishing the tune.

## Difficulty

* **Surdos**: medium
* **Repinique**: medium
* **Snare**: hard
* **Tam**: easy (alternatives available)
* **Agogô**: medium

## Breaks

* **Break 1** is a longer call and response for repis and snares. It sounds great once you've got it!
* **Break 2** is a short call and response for repis based on the clave rhythm (like most of our Samba Reggae breaks). It's a good break to start with when you're learning them, and you can get different instruments to lead it (sign Break 2 – agogô for agogôs to lead it, for instance)
* **Break 3** is a longer call and response for surdos _\[uncommon nationally\]_
* The **Call break** is medium-length and has a little tam solo doing their main clave part. Some bands use this as a general break _\[not played nationally\]_
* The **SOS break** has the same rhythm as the first part of the call break but is shorter and based on call and response with surdos. It also has a quirk where repis keep playing their part here back in the main part until the next SOS break _\[not played nationally\]_
* **General breaks** that work well: Clave, Knock on the Door
