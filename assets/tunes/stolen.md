**Sign:** Fingers past your eyes

## Background

**Name:** A new XR Rhythms tune “borrowed” rather more directly than the others.

**Musical background:** Sounds like any number of Olodum songs, but specifically taken from [this song](https://youtu.be/0Pq8vOVbvzs) by the brilliant Colombian band Aainjaa.

The difficulty mostly comes from us feeling the song as double time, so breaks will go twice as fast as usual:

instead of *1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +*, it's *1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4*

A helpful tip is to start the snares off first to get everyone in time.

**Sign:** like a cartoon burglar mask

**History:** Introduced to XR Rhythms in 2021. It's our only non-RoR tune.

## Difficulty

* **Low Surdo:** hard
* **Mid/High Surdo:** medium
* **Repi:** hard
* **Snare:** easy
* **Tam:** hard (the rhythm is different from everyone else)
* **Agogô:** medium

## Breaks

* **Break 1** is tricky to get the timing on, especially if you play the tune fast. Start slow and let it groove!
* The **2/4 break** is a short one that works well as an intro or quick bridge
* **General breaks** that work well: 4 hits, 8 hits, Progressive Karla (gets very fast at the end — try having the agogôs play in the gap!), Whistle break (played straight rather than swung)
