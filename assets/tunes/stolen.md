**Sign:** Fingers past your eyes

## Background

**Name:** A new XR Rhythms tune "borrowed" rather more directly than the others.

**Musical background:** Sounds like any number of Olodum songs. *(More info needed.)*

The difficulty mostly comes from the song being felt as double time, so breaks will go twice as fast as usual:

instead of *1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +*, it's *1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4*

A helpful tip is to start the snares off first to get everyone in time.

**Sign:** Like a cartoon burglar mask

**History:** Introduced to XR Rhythms in 2019? It's our only non-RoR tune. *(More info needed.)*

## Difficulty

* **Surdos:** hard
* **Repi:** hard
* **Snare:** easy
* **Tamborim:** medium
* **Agogô:** medium

## Breaks

* **Break 1** is tricky to get the timing on, especially if you play the tune fast. Start slow and let it groove!
* The **2/4 break** is a short break from London that works well as an intro or quick bridge.
* **General breaks** that work well: 4 hits, 8 hits, Progressive Karla (gets very fast at the end — try having the agogôs play in the gap!).
