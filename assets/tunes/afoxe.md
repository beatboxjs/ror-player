**Sign:** Shaving the armpit

## Background

**Name:** Afoxé can refer to a rhythm from Brazilian carnival, a certain kind of rattle from Brazilian music, or a dance- and music formation in the Carnival. All three meanings developed out of Candomblé, a creole religion which evolved through slaves from West Africa who were forcefully brought to South America by white slave traders. The enslaved black people in Brazil passed on the religious rites through generations. Candomblé is still practiced by some Afro-Brazilians today ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afox%C3%AA)).

**Musical background:** The tune sounds very similar to some Afoxé rhythms from Brazil ([YouTube](https://youtu.be/WCah-JgDktA?t=301)).

**Sign:** The sign comes from the name sounding similar to “aftershave” or “had-a-shave”.

**History:** Part of the second round of tunes that was introduced by Barking Bateria in 2004/2005.

## Controversies

Since this rhythm is directly rooted in Afro-Brazilian religion, many people in the RoR network consider it cultural appropriation to play it. There is ongoing debate on whether this tune should be abandoned, and some bands have already stopped playing it.

There is also some criticism about the sign, since it ridicules the spiritual meaning of the rhythm, and shaving armpits is a loaded topic in our patriarchal society.
