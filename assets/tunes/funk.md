This is one of our core tunes, and often the first one new bands learn.

It doesn't sound much like funk, which is something of a theme with RoR tunes.

**Sign:** two OK signs above your head looking like funky glasses

## Background

**Name:** Funk is a style of music that was created in the 1960s by African Americans. It originates from African musical traditions and has also been used heavily in Black liberation movements throughout history. The pioneer of funk is James Brown. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funk))

**Musical background:** Probably based on the Brazilian samba reggae interpretation of funk rather than the James Brown version.

**Sign:** Based on the funky glasses that the pioneering funk bassist Bootsy Collins used to wear ([for example](https://media.npr.org/assets/artslife/arts/2009/10/bootsy-fa-0a236a00a27e682eed7c121e1f0454d4be5adee0-s600-c85.webp))

**History:** Was introduced to the network at least 2008. A slightly different version called “Lego Funk” has been played by Barking Bateria: [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/barking-bateria/lego-funk)

## Difficulty

* **Low Surdo**: easy
* **Mid/high Surdo and Tam**: easy
* **Repi**: medium. There are two repi parts, one harder one for playing with one stick and one easier (but longer) one for two sticks
* **Snare**: easy
* **Agogô**: easy

## Breaks

* **Break 1**, a relatively involved call and response between surdos and everyone else _\[uncommon nationally\]_
* **Break 2**, where everyone plays one bar of eighth-notes _\[uncommon nationally\]_
* **General breaks** that work well: Conga, Little Cat, Flappy mouth
* Some bands use Angela Davis breaks with Funk instead
