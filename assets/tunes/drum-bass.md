Sounds more like hip-hop than drum 'n' bass but has a really nice groove. Can be very cheerful when played fast
or groovy when played slow.

The rhythm for the low surdo part is tricky, so try thinking of it together with the highs or put in hand mutes on beats 2 and 4.

We learned this tune at summer camp 2022, so it's a little less established than the others. If you're playing it nationally you'll probably want to remind people of the parts, though everyone likes it once it gets going.

**Sign:** With one hand in your ear lift the other and move it front and back (like a DJ).

## Background

**Name:** Drum 'n' bass is a style of UK electronic music from the 90s. It's characterised by its really fast and strong bass. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drum_and_bass))

**Musical background:** The bassline somewhat resembles drum 'n' bass, although drum 'n' bass is usually played much faster at 165–185 bpm, while our tunes are usually around 100–120 bpm. At this speed, it sounds more like hip-hop, and a very similar bassline can be heard in several hip-hop songs e.g. [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UePtoxDhJSw).

**Sign:** The sign is like a DJ scratching.

**History:** First mentioned in 2010 by RoR Bremen and developed on a transnational basis between 2009 and 2010. Barking Bateria also mentions a tune with this name [on their website](https://web.archive.org/web/20061023061031/http://www.barkingbateria.co.uk/samba.htm) in 2006, although it's not clear if it's the same tune.

If you're wondering why there's no Break 1 or Break 3, it's because this is where the retired Everybody Dance Now breaks came from (short was Break 1, long added in Break 3).

## Difficulty

* **Low Surdo:** hard
* **Mid/High Surdo:** easy
* **Repi:** hard
* **Snare:** medium
* **Tam:** easy
* **Agogô:** medium


## Breaks

* **Break 2** is double-time feel so sounds more like actual DnB, but that can make it tricky going back into the main tune
* The **Call break** (aka. Hip-Hop Break) is a fun extended thing that's probably a bit too involved for us to use generally _\[not played nationally\]_
* **General breaks** that work well: Progressive Karla
