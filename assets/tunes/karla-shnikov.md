This is one of our core tunes and often one of the first ones that new bands learn.

**Sign:** move index and middle finger like rabbit ears (air quotes) and cover other fingers with other hand

## Background

**Name:** Originally called Kalashnikov but changed to “Karla Shnikov” (ignoring how Slavic names work), an invented female revolutionary.

**Musical background:** *(More info needed.)*

**Sign:** One of Karla's actions was liberating the biggest rabbit farm in Russia. The sign depicts rabbit ears, an improvement on miming shooting yourself in the head.

**History:** The tune was invented in London. The name was changed because some bands got in trouble for showing a gun, and other bands didn’t want to have a tune named after a weapon. The story of Karla Shnikov was made up by the working group thinking up a new name and sign for the tune and how people like Karla likely did exist since the historical contributions of women are often unrecorded.

## Difficulty

* **Surdos**: medium (can be tricky keeping that double hit in time – it ends just before the the beat)
* **Mid/High Surdos**: easy
* **Repi**: medium
* **Snare**: easy
* **Tam**: easy
* **Agogô**:easy

## Breaks

* We play the **Karla break** (which used to be Break 1 here, hence the name) and **Progressive Karla** for this song with the repis playing their main part instead of the bar of silence
* **Break 2** has rolls and a call and response with surdos _\[less common nationally\]_
* **Break 2 inverted** has the rolls, the call and response, the call and response again, and then the rolls again _\[uncommon nationally\]_
