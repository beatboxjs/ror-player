Together with Samba Reggae, this is the tune which sounds most like “real” samba.

**Sign:** making an offer to the sky

## Background

**Name:** From the tam/agogô mnemonic “I’ve got custard in my underpants”, which is... certainly memorable.

**Musical background:** A typical Samba Reggae-style tune.

**Sign:** used to be a “W” for Welfare State (the former name of the tune), as can be seen in this [video](https://tube.rhythms-of-resistance.org/w/3LnZ6d58J1jd5GNzK1mQqp) by RoR London. It changed into the current sign and can also be interpreted as “holding a plate of custard”.

**History:** Part of the first set of tunes taken from Barking Bateria in 2000. Used to be called Welfare State, but was renamed because people don’t like the state.

## Controversies

The rhythm clearly sounds like Samba Reggae, which is a tune developed and used by the Black liberation movement in Brazil. Many people in the RoR network consider it cultural appropriation to play this tune in our mainly white European bands, and there is ongoing debate about abolishing the tune.

## Difficulty

* **Surdos**: medium
* **Repi**: medium
* **Snare**: medium
* **Tam**: medium (easy to mix up with Afoxé, tiring)
* **Agogô**: medium (easy to mix up with Afoxé)

## Breaks

* **Breaks 1 and 2** are call and response versions of the tam/agogô line. In Break 1 surdos call, in Break 2 it's tams.
* **Break 3** can be used to solo particular instruments _\[uncommon nationally\]_
* **Break 5** is a call and response between snares and everyone else _\[not played nationally\]_
