The **XR Rhythms Player** is here to help you on your journey with protest samba fusion.

It absolutely isn't telling you the “right way” to play: it’s a resource for learning and practising the tunes and breaks that XR Rhythms UK bands tend to play when we're all together, prioritising what’s commonest and most accessible for newer players and bands.

Individual bands can and will do their own thing and that’s great – that’s where real folk traditions come from, after all. More advanced players can treat the material here as more of an outline, and we've got a few of the more established fancier parts listed as alternatives (though again, that's not the priority).

Have fun, wear earplugs and see you in the streets!
